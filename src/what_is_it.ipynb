    "\n",
    "Also known as Life, is a cellular automaton created by the mathematician [John Horton Conway](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Conway/) in 1970. It is a [zero-player](https://gamephilosophy.org/wp-content/uploads/confmanuscripts/pcg2012/Bjor%20Juul%202012%20-Zero-player-games-Exploring-the-distinction-between-Games-as-Artifacts-and-Games-as-Activities.pdf) game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. Life is not just a static mathematical construct but a dynamic system teeming with life, death, and emergent patterns. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. <span style=\"font-size: 6px; font-family: Verdana; letter-spacing: 3px;\">AKA THE GAME PLAYS ITSELF</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The universe of the Game of Life is an [infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_tiling) cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight [neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood), which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins with an initial pattern, or seed. Rules are applied simultaneously to every cell to form the first generation, with births and deaths occurring at the same time (a tick). Each generation is is a [pure function](https://adabeat.com/fp/pure-functions-in-functional-programming/) from the previous one, and this process repeats to create further generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Many patterns](https://conwaylife.appspot.com/library/) can emerge in a typical run of the Game of Life. Some patterns remain static, while others oscillate or move across the screen. Certain patterns can even generate new patterns, adding to the simulation's complexity and dynamism."

    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration, or generation, these rules dictate the fate of each cell based on its current state and the state of its neighboring cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>Underpopulation:</b> Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, simulating the effects of isolation and scarcity.\n",
    "2. <b>Survival:</b> A live cell with two or three live neighbors continues to thrive into the next generation, maintaining a delicate balance between life and its surroundings.\n",
    "3. <b>Overpopulation:</b> When a live cell is surrounded by more than three live neighbors, it succumbs to overpopulation and dies, reminiscent of resource depletion.\n",
    "4. <b>Reproduction:</b> If a dead cell finds itself neighbored by exactly three live cells, it springs to life in the next generation, mirroring the concept of reproduction and renewal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code snippet demonstrates the application of the rules of Conway's Game of Life to determine the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the number of living neighbours it has."
