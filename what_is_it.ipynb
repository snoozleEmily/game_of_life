    "# [The Game of Life ìçº‡Ωº](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) \n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as Life, is a cellular automaton created by the mathematician [John Horton Conway](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Conway/) in 1970. It is a [zero-player](https://gamephilosophy.org/wp-content/uploads/confmanuscripts/pcg2012/Bjor%20Juul%202012%20-Zero-player-games-Exploring-the-distinction-between-Games-as-Artifacts-and-Games-as-Activities.pdf) game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. <span style=\"font-size: 6px; font-family: Verdana; letter-spacing: 3px;\">AKA THE GAME PLAYS ITSELF</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The universe of the Game of Life is an [infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_tiling) cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight [neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood), which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins with an initial pattern, or seed. Rules are applied simultaneously to every cell to form the first generation, with births and deaths occurring at the same time (a tick). Each generation is is a [pure function](https://adabeat.com/fp/pure-functions-in-functional-programming/) from the previous one, and this process repeats to create further generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many patterns can emerge in a typical run of the Game of Life. Some patterns remain static, while others oscillate or move across the screen. Certain patterns can even generate new patterns, adding to the simulation's complexity and dynamism."
