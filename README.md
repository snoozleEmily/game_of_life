# Game of Life

This is a simple version of the Game of Life, an implementation of the classic cellular automaton!

## Why Notebooks Were Used

This project was created using Jupyter Notebooks for educational purposes. The goal was to practice using the numpy and matplotlib libraries, and Jupyter Notebooks facilitate documenting the process, explaining the code, and illustrating the logic of the game. Also, notebooks are excellent for visualization, making it easier to understand the concepts being demonstrated.
